    "# BYO Container Example:  lightGBM\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll examine how to BYO container in Amazon SageMaker.  This is an option for algorithms and frameworks not directly supported in Amazon SageMaker as either (1) built-in algorithms, or (2) prebuilt Amazon SageMaker containers (such as the ones for TensorFlow, PyTorch, Apache MXNet, Scikit-learn, and XGBoost).  As an example, we'll containerize the popular lightGBM gradient boosting framework, which is not supported off-the-shelf in Amazon SageMaker, and apply it to a public dataset from UCI's Machine Learning Repository.  The dataset, which relates to predicting purchase intent by online shoppers, is at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides BYO container, we'll also employ the following features:  SageMaker Processing for data preprocessing, SageMaker hosted training, SageMaker Processing for model evaluation/batch scoring, and endpoints for real time inference.  More specifically, we'll perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Obtain the dataset.\n",
    "- Build a Docker image for lightGBM to be run as a container in SageMaker Processing.\n",
    "- Preprocess the data with that image in SageMaker Processing.\n",
    "- Build a separate Docker image for lightGBM for training models with SageMaker hosted training.\n",
    "- Train a lightGBM model with that separate Docker image in SageMaker hosted training.\n",
    "- Evaluate the model / do batch scoring in SageMaker Processing with the same container used for preprocessing.\n",
    "- Build a separate Docker container for model serving using [Multi-Model Server](https://github.com/awslabs/multi-model-server/).\n",
    "- Deploy the model to a real time SageMaker endpoind.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PREREQUISITES:**  Be sure to run this notebook on an instance or machine that supports Docker, with AWS IAM permissions to Amazon S3 and Amazon SageMaker (full access to both is fine for learning purposes).  In the notebook below we'll also add access to Amazon ECR.\n",
