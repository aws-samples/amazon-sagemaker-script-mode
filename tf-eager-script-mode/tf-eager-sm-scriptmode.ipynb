    "# Utilizing TensorFlow Eager Execution with Amazon SageMaker’s Script Mode \n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with TensorFlow version 1.11, you can use SageMaker's prebuilt TensorFlow containers with TensorFlow training scripts similar to those you would use outside SageMaker. This feature is named Script Mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will use Script Mode in conjunction with TensorFlow's Eager Execution mode, which will become the default execution mode of TensorFlow 2 onwards.  Eager execution is an imperative interface where operations are executed immediately, rather than building a static computational graph. Advantages of Eager Execution include a more intuitive interface with natural Python control flow and less boilerplate, easier debugging, and support for dynamic models and almost all of the available TensorFlow operations. It also features close integration with tf.keras to make rapid prototyping even easier.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate how Eager Execution works with Script Mode, this notebook focuses on presenting a relatively complete workflow. The workflow includes local and SageMaker hosted training, as well as local and SageMaker hosted inference, in the context of a straightforward regression task.  This task involves predicting house prices based on the well-known Boston Housing dataset. More specifically, this public dataset contains 13 features regarding housing stock of towns in the Boston area, including features such as average number of rooms, accessibility to radial highways, adjacency to the Charles River, etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we'll import some necessary packages and set up directories for training and test data, and direct TensorFlow to use Eager Execution mode rather than the default graph mode of TensorFlow 1.x.  "
